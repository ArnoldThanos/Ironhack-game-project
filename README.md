## Introduction

Wake Up is a game I built in week three of Ironhack bootcamp in Berlin. Wake Up is jump and run game that runs in the browser. I aimed to give the game a minimalistic design and an eerie feeling.

## Used technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript
- the canvas HTML element to draw
  
## Media

- The images that are displayed between levels are fetched from The Mars Api.
